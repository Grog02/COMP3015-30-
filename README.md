## How to run executable file.

### What it was created on
This is an OpenGL project created using Windows 11 and Visual Studio 2022

## The Scene
When the .exe file is executed, there will be a snow-covered mountain with thick fog surrounding it. Controls are shown down below for how to navigate it. 
Whilst it is a simple scene, I believe the colour and intensity of the fog makes it look a lot more like a snowy and cold mountain, giving the scene a more realistic atmosphere.

## Why I chose Blinn-Phong 
In my program, I have two shader files - a Fragment Shader and a Vertex Shader. (Both found in Project_Template -> shader). 
In the Fragment Shader, I am using a BlinnPhong model because I believe it can provide some very visually pleasing results while also being less complicated than other models. 
As someone who is not very skilled with OpenGL or GLSL (openGL Shader Language), I found Blinn-Phong to be an effective model to acheive my desired results.

## Controls

Left Click (hold) - Rotate camera and hides mouse cursor
Left Click (release) - resets the mouse cursor position to the middle of the window and shows the cursor
